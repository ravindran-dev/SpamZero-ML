# SpamZero - Email Spam Detection using Support Vector Machines
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset contains features extracted from email text content, and the model is trained to effectively distinguish between spam and legitimate emails.



## Project Structure
```kotlin
├── Email Spam Detection - Vector machines.ipynb
├── README.md
├── data/
│   └── spam_dataset.csv (or relevant dataset)
├── models/
│   └── svm_model.pkl
```


## Technologies Used
- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Scikit-learn

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)



## Dataset
- The dataset includes features derived from email contents such as:

- Frequency of specific keywords

- Capital letter usage

- Special character frequency

- Each email is labeled as:

  - 1 → Spam

  - 0 → Not Spam


## How to Run
- Clone the Repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/RAVINDRAN-S/Email_Spam_Detection_using_vector_machines
cd email-spam-detection-svm
```
- Install Dependencies

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook
```
- Open Email Spam Detection - Vector machines.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
